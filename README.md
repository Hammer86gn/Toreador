# Toreador

### What is Toreador?
Toreador is an opensource game engine made by [Chloe](https://github.com/Hammer86gn), [tecc](https://github.com/tecc), 
and [8Blits](https://github.com/8Blits) to be used for the [Github Game Off Game Jam in 2022](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022).

Toreador is licensed under the extremely permissive Apache 2.0 license which means if you want to use it you can!

### Plans for Toreador
The current plans for Toreador are mainly to get a working 2D engine by the time the Github Game Off Game Jam starts.


### Thirdparty Libraries
Currently Toreador uses [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) in order to fully use OpenGL.
We plan on keeping the amount of external dependencies low as it adds to the challenge and excitement of making an engine.
